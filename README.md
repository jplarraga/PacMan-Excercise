# PacMan-Excercise
This is a basic animation Excercise using Arcade's image PacMan
<img src="images/pacman_readme.png" alt="pacmen excercise">

<h2> Description </h2>
<p> This prject is a simple <b>animation excercise</b> in which I use an arcade-based Pacman image and I give it movement taking certain parameters such as the direction of the image, the change in postition, the focus which is the state of the face of the Pacman and then I set a function to make the image to be excecuted over a specific time interval</p>
<br>

<h2>Instalation</h2>
<ul>
<li>The code is free to download on this respository</li>
<li>You might just need a code editor and an Internet Browser, my recomendation<b>Chrome</b></li>
<li>If you are using<b>VSCode</b> I recommend to download the<b>Live Server</b> extension so you can see your changes as soon as you hit <i>Comand+s</i></li>  
</ul>
<br>
  
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p> This excercise has basically learning purposes, there are some interesting aplications on the use of two dimentional arrays, on how to call a function in a certain interval of time and how to create a switch 1 -0-1 logic in order to alternate outcomes. The applications of the concepts are enormous however the excersise itself pretty much explains the behaviour of a function that animates an image </p>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<p> This is the first project and I don't spect to add future improvements, however I am Strongly encouraged to keep adding repositories related to the same excercise but I will keep adding more complexity or more variables in it so it gets more dynamic and up to the point where the game is created<p>
